implementated using the Unity3D framework

**Goal**

- *To learn, experiement and practice the principles of SOLID and OOD/OOP*
- *Further understanding of graph algorithms (A-Star pathfinding for AI)*
- *Increase proficiency with the C# language*

**About**

As an exercise I decided to implement a simple game, tic-tac-toe in this 
case, while at the same time explore and experiment with known principles of
OOP. For me, the Unity3D framework is a platform where I can
study both the language of C# and hopefully develop and hone
good design habits.

The project is in a state of constant flux.

My intention is for the *master* branch to always be the latest stable build -- it
usually is but it is also usually, behind the latest commit. So if you're 
interested, view the other branches to see the most current iterations. With the exception
of the *dev_branch*, they will usually be named by number.
