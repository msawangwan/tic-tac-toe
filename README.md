An simple (yet, complicated) implementation using the Unity3D framework
-

**Goal**

*To learn and study the principles of SOLID and OOD/OOP*

**About**

As someone who is relatively new to programming, I decided to
implement a simple game, tic-tac-toe in this case, while at the
same time explore and experiment with known principles of
OOP. For me, the Unity3D framework is a platform where I can
study both the language of C# and hopefully develop and hone
good design habits.

The project is in a state of constant flux.

My intention is for the *master* branch to always be stable, yet
it is also always behind. So if you're interested, view the other branches
to see the latest iteration.
