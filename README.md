#Tic-Tac-Toe (3-in-a-Row) in Unity3D

* * *

###About

Tic-tac-toe.

Download and run in Unity, or export the scene (only 1 scene).

I simply wanted to see if I could implement an AI, and make it unbeatable. I ended up using the
minimax algorithm.

###Project State

The app is basically complete but needs a few minor improvements:

- *Settings Menu*
- *Audio and graphics*
