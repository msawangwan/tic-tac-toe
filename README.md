tic-tac-toe (wip)

implementated using the Unity3D framework

**Goal**

*To learn and study the principles of SOLID and OOD/OOP*

**About**

As someone who is relatively new to programming, I decided to
implement a simple game, tic-tac-toe in this case, while at the
same time explore and experiment with known principles of
OOP. For me, the Unity3D framework is a platform where I can
study both the language of C# and hopefully develop and hone
good design habits.

The project is in a state of constant flux.

My intention is for the *master* branch to always be stable, yet 
this doesn't appear to be working as planned. Instead it is usually 
behind. So if you're interested, view the other branches to see 
the more current iterations.
